### Javascript Runtime
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/): asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime. Version used is 16.14.2

### Javascript superset

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/): TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing. 

### Server side: 

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### Database

* [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb): MongoDB is a NoSQL document database. I used him because it is easy to use and has a good performance.
'
### Cache 

* [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/about/): Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine..I used Redis to cache.

### API Request

* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro): Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests. I used to make requests in Currency API.

### Git Hooks

* [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/): Husky improves your commits, you can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc... when you commit or push. Husky supports all Git hooks. I use to run tests before commits.

### Testing

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/): Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

* [Supertest](https://openbase.com/js/supertest/documentation): The motivation with this module is to provide a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent. I used to test API routes.

### Node tools
* [Ts-node-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev): It restarts target node process when any of required files changes (as standard node-dev) but shares Typescript compilation process between restarts.

## [How to run locally](#summary)

### [Using docker](#summary)

1. First you need to clone or fork this repository
2. You need have docker installed in your machine.
3. Run ```docker build -t node_backend .```
  * If you change "node_backend" name, you need to change this name at docker-compose file too.  
4. run ```docker compose up -d```
  * "-d" (or --detach) is optional, using it means that docker container will run in the background of your terminal.
  * After running this command, you will have aplication running in your machine at port 3000, mongodb at port 27017 and redis at port 6379.

5. If you do not have docker in your computer, you can make these steps using [codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) or [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/screencasts/getting-started-with-gitpod).

## [Routes](#summary)
### Base URL
Base URL is ```localhost:3000``` in your machine. 

### Product properties

```JSON
{
  "_id": "63fd2d4e1ed729e1ba09e3bd", // this is an id generated by mongodb
  "name": "product name", // it should be a string
  "price": 12, // it should be a Number
  "description": "product description", // it should be a string
  "id": "e4fb7c0c-e441-4a8a-8b11-7e7143b8dd88" // this is an id generated by node.js
}
```

<h3 id="post-products">POST -> /Products</h3>
* You need to send a request body with these properties:

```JSON
{
  "name": "product", // String
  "price": 2000, // Number
  "description": "product description" // String
}
```

* You cannot create a product with a existing name. If you try, it will return a **status code 400** and a body with this message:
```JSON
"already exists a product with this name"
```
* If you create a product with correct properties and an nonexisitng name, it will return a **status code 200** and a body with all informations you send and a id and mongodb id(_id). Example:

You create a product with properties: "name":"nonexisting name", "price": 8, "description":"product description".

it returns: 
```JSON
{
    "name": "nonexisting name",
    "price": 8,
    "description": "product description",
    "id": "870b3276-f38f-435c-928f-1cceb2507eb1",
    "_id": "63fd35131ed729e1ba09e3c0"
}
```


<h3 id="get-products">GET -> /Products</h3>
It will return a **status code 200** and body returns an array of products. These products will have Product properties.
Example: 

```JSON
[
  {
    "_id":"63fd2d4e1ed729e1ba09e3bd",
    "name":"product",
    "price":123, 
    "description":"description",
    "id":"e4fb7c0c-e441-4a8a-8b11-7e7143b8dd88"
  },
  {
  "_id":"63fd2d5d1ed729e1ba09e3be",
  "name":"product 2",
  "price":123,
  "description":"description",
  "id":"f0642985-8cfb-4afd-8d12-4f156539c784"
  },
  {
  "_id":"63fd2f5b1ed729e1ba09e3bf",
  "name":"best product",
  "price":12,
  "description":"description",
  "id":"f3e90d4c-3b7f-4af3-88f2-1c25693c49d3"
  }
]
```

<h3 id="get-product">Get -> /Products/:id</h3>

* If you put an existent id, it will return a **status code 200** and in body it will return a product with this id and prices in USD and EUR.
Example:
```JSON
{
    "_id": "63fd2f5b1ed729e1ba09e3bf",
    "name": "best product",
    "price": 12,
    "description": "description",
    "id": "f3e90d4c-3b7f-4af3-88f2-1c25693c49d3",
    "priceInUSD": "2.31",
    "priceInEUR": "2.17"
}
```

* If you put a nonexistent id, it will return a **status code 400** and body with message:
```JSON
"product not found"
```

<h3 id="put-product">PUT -> /Products/:id</h3>
* We will use this product as example.

```JSON
{
   "_id": "63fd2f5b1ed729e1ba09e3bf",
    "name": "best product",
    "price": 12,
    "description": "description",
    "id": "f3e90d4c-3b7f-4af3-88f2-1c25693c49d3"
}
```
1. With PUT method you can edit your product. You are enabled to edit: name, price and description.
2. In request body you do not need to fill with all enable props, you can put just price, or name, or description.
3. You cannot change your product name to a name of a already existing product.

* If everything works out fine, it will return a **status code 200** and a body with product 
updated.

Example:

URL: ```localhost:3000/Products/f3e90d4c-3b7f-4af3-88f2-1c25693c49d3```

request body: 
```JSON
{
  "price": 0.5
}
```

response body: 
```JSON
{
  "_id": "63fd2f5b1ed729e1ba09e3bf",
  "name": "best product",
  "price": 0.5,
  "description": "description",
  "id": "f3e90d4c-3b7f-4af3-88f2-1c25693c49d3"
}
```

* If you make any of the mentioned mistakes, it will return a **status code 400** and a body with message: ``` "Product not foud or you named a existent name" ```

<h3 id="delete-product">DELETE -> /Products/:id</h3>

1. In this API DELETE method is very easy, you just need product id.
2. You pass it as a param after ```"/Products/<here>"```

3. If you pass an id of an existing product, it will delete him. It will return a **status code 200** and body with message: ```"Product deleted successfully"```
4. If you pass an unexisting product id, it will return a **status code 400** and a body with message: ```"Does not exists a product with this id"```

<h3 id="get-currency">GET -> /Currency</h3>

* This route returns an array with all Currencies used (USD and EUR).
* <p id="currency-props">Each currency has properties:</p> 

```JSON

    "code": "USD", // A string with currency code name.
    "codein": "BRL", // all currencies have a 'codein' BRL because it is converted to BRL
    "name": "DÃ³lar Americano/Real Brasileiro", 
    "high": "5.2426" // high currency value
  }
```
